# Background

In June of 2020, my wife and I decided to move out of NYC in favor of living in the east coast country. We've been living in NYC for 15 years and covid made us realize we wanted to live closer to nature. We drew a 90 minute circle around NYC, rented a car and drove all around: PA, Upstate NY, Western Mass and CT. Initially we were looking for a house, however, most houses on the market in northeastern US are colonial style that are at least 35 years old. We expanded our search to plots of land. The first piece of land we saw was a huge hilly and forested deep down a private gravel road in Roxbury CT. We walked up an old logger's trail on the property, crossing a creek, settling at a plateau surrounded by rocky hills. It was exactly where I wanted to live.
